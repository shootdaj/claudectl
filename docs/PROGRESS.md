# Progress

## 2026-01-12

### Completed
- **Unified `n` key workflow**: Consolidated separate keybindings (n/N/Shift+P) into single `n` key entry point
  - Quick question: Starts in `~/.claudectl/scratch/` with no git
  - Clone repo: Clone from GitHub
  - Promote to project: When on scratch session, promotes to full project with git + private GitHub repo
- **Footer cleanup**: Removed "P Project" from footer, now just shows "n New"
- **`/wrapup` command**: Created new Claude Code skill for session wrap-up (document, self-improve, commit, push)
